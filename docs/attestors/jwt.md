# JWT Attestor

The JWT ([JSON Web Token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)) Attestor verifies a JWT against a JWKS ([JSON Web Key Set](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets)) and records information about the
claims of the JWT.  The JWK that was used to verify the JWT is also recorded.
