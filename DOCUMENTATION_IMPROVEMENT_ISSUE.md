# Improve Witness Documentation: Comprehensive Enhancement Plan

## Overview

Following a thorough analysis of the current Witness documentation, we've identified several areas that need improvement to better serve developers and users. This issue outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance documentation quality, coverage, and maintainability.

## Current State

Our documentation has a solid foundation with:
- ✅ Automated schema generation for attestors
- ✅ Basic documentation for all 25 attestors
- ✅ Command reference documentation
- ✅ Getting started tutorial

However, significant gaps exist that impact developer experience and adoption.

## Identified Gaps

### 1. Attestor Documentation Issues
- **Missing "When to Use" sections**: Developers don't know which attestors to choose
- **No configuration examples**: Flags are listed but not demonstrated
- **Limited output examples**: Hard to understand what attestations contain
- **No security guidance**: Missing warnings about sensitive data

### 2. Missing Documentation Areas
- **CI/CD Integration Guides**: No guides for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- **Policy Language Reference**: Rego syntax and patterns undocumented
- **Developer API Guide**: No documentation for using Witness as a library
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: No help for common errors or issues

### 3. Documentation Generation Limitations
- Cannot auto-generate attestor flags documentation
- No extraction of examples from tests
- Configuration documentation is manual
- No API documentation from godoc comments

## Proposed Improvements

### Phase 1: High Priority (Immediate Need)

#### 1.1 Complete Attestor Documentation
Each attestor needs these sections:
- [ ] Clear purpose and use cases
- [ ] All configuration flags with examples
- [ ] Real-world usage examples
- [ ] Sample output
- [ ] Security considerations

**Template to follow:**
```markdown
# [Name] Attestor

## Overview
What this attestor does and why you'd use it

## When to Use
- Specific scenario 1
- Specific scenario 2

## Configuration
| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|

## Examples
### Basic Usage
```bash
witness run -a [name] -s step -- command
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
witness run -a [name] --flag=value -s step -- command
```

## Output Example
```json
{
  "type": "...",
  "attestation": {}
}
```

## Security Considerations
- Important warnings
- Best practices
```

#### 1.2 CI/CD Integration Guides
Create guides for:
- [ ] GitHub Actions (with reusable workflows)
- [ ] GitLab CI (with job templates)
- [ ] Jenkins (with pipeline examples)
- [ ] Azure DevOps
- [ ] CircleCI

#### 1.3 Policy Language Documentation
- [ ] Complete Rego reference for Witness policies
- [ ] Common policy patterns library
- [ ] Step-by-step policy writing tutorial
- [ ] Policy debugging guide

### Phase 2: Medium Priority

#### 2.1 Enhanced Documentation Generation
Extend `docgen` tool to:
- [ ] Auto-generate attestor flag documentation
- [ ] Extract configuration schema from structs
- [ ] Pull examples from test files
- [ ] Generate API docs from godoc

#### 2.2 Developer Documentation
- [ ] Go library API reference
- [ ] Custom attestor development guide
- [ ] Integration patterns
- [ ] Best practices guide

#### 2.3 Operational Guides
- [ ] Troubleshooting common errors
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security best practices
- [ ] Migration from other tools

### Phase 3: Lower Priority

#### 3.1 Interactive Documentation
- [ ] Policy playground
- [ ] Attestation explorer
- [ ] Interactive tutorials

#### 3.2 Advanced Topics
- [ ] Air-gapped deployments
- [ ] Multi-region Archivista
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1-2: Attestor Documentation
- Update all 25 attestor docs with the new template
- Add practical examples from real use cases
- Document all configuration options

### Week 3-4: CI/CD Guides
- Create GitHub Actions integration guide
- Create GitLab CI integration guide
- Create Jenkins integration guide

### Week 5-6: Policy Documentation
- Write comprehensive policy language reference
- Create policy pattern library
- Add policy debugging guide

### Week 7-8: Documentation Tooling
- Enhance docgen for better automation
- Set up example extraction from tests
- Implement documentation CI checks

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 100% of attestors have complete documentation
- [ ] All major CI/CD platforms have integration guides
- [ ] Policy language is fully documented with examples
- [ ] Documentation stays in sync with code automatically
- [ ] New users can get started within 30 minutes

## Resources Needed

- Documentation review from maintainers
- Example workflows from production users
- Test cases for documentation examples
- CI/CD platform access for testing

## Notes

This is a significant documentation effort that will greatly improve the Witness user experience. We should prioritize the high-impact items (attestor docs, CI/CD guides) while building toward better automation to ensure long-term maintainability.
